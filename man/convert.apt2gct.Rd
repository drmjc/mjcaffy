\arguments{
  \item{rma.apt.file}{path to an rma file created by APT.
  This should work with files created by other algorithms
  like PLIER or gcrma, but that hasn't been tested. must be
  present.}

  \item{dabg.apt.file}{path to a dabg file created by APT.
  must be present.}

  \item{clm.file}{optional clm file describing which arrays
  to include, in which order & how you'd like them to be
  renamed.}

  \item{chip.file}{optional chip file describing each
  probeset. recommended if you want to filter out the
  control probesets.}

  \item{out.dir}{where to output the res/gct/cls files?
  Defaults to the dir that the clm file lives in.}

  \item{create.gct}{do you want gct files, and/or res files
  to be created?}

  \item{create.res}{do you want gct files, and/or res files
  to be created?}

  \item{create.cls}{using the supplied clm file, create a
  cls file?}

  \item{keep.controls}{keep, or exclude the control
  probes?}

  \item{all.genes}{generate res/gct files for all probes on
  the array (after the optional control-probe filtering)}

  \item{expressed.genes}{generate res/gct files for
  expressed probes on the array (with at least one DABG
  p-val of <= detection.threshold)}

  \item{detection.threshold}{p-value threshold for
  detecting expressed genes}
}
\value{
  none. it writes out gct,res,cls files.
